# Diet-recall-application
Our project aims to create an easy-to-use app that helps users track their daily food intake, understand  nutritional content, set and achieve fitness goals, plan workouts, receive reminders, and get personalized support. 

Our 8 Major Objectives of our project are:-
1. Diet Tracking: Enable users to record and track their daily food intake, including meals, snacks, and beverages, in a user-friendly and efficient manner.
2. Nutrient Analysis: Provide users with detailed information about the nutritional content of their diet, including calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).
3. Reminder and Notification System: Implement reminders and notifications to encourage users to log their meals regularly, stay on track with their goals, and provide feedback or suggestions based on their recorded data.
4. Goal Setting and Tracking: Allow users to set specific fitness goals (e.g., weight   loss, muscle gain, improved cardiovascular endurance) and track their progress over time
5. Workout Planning: Facilitate the creation of customized workout plans by allowing users to schedule exercises, set rest intervals, and design routines tailored to their goals and time constraints.
6. User Support and Guidance: Offer access to educational resources, workout tips, and guidance on proper nutrition, recovery, and injury prevention to support users in their fitness journey.
7. Meal Recommendations: Provide users with meal recommendations based on their fitness goals, nutritional needs, and dietary preferences. These recommendations can take into account the user's workout schedule and the specific nutrient requirements for pre-workout and post-workout meals.
8. Recipe Database: Develop a robust and diverse recipe database that includes healthy meal options suitable for various dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) and fitness goals (e.g., muscle building, weight loss).
